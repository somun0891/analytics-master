## Request checklist
To support the new data source triage process, try to complete the below checklist. If there is anything not sure or unknown, you can skip that point.
 
* [ ] Prefix the issue name with 'New Data Source: ', e.g. 'New Data Source: NetSuite AP data'
* [ ] Review the [current data available in the EDW](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/business-technology/data-team/platform/#extract-and-load) and confirm it concerns a new pipeline, or a change/extension of an existing pipeline:
  - [ ] Complete new pipeline
  - [ ] Change/extension of an existing pipeline: `     `
* [ ] Do any objects in this data source need to be snapshotted? If yes, please open separate issues to have the objects snapshotted.
* [ ] Does it contain MNPI data (see the [SAFE guide](https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/legal/safe-framework/#sensitive) for more information about MNPI)?
* [ ] Does it contain [Personal Data](https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/security/data-classification-standard/#data-classification-definitions)?
* [ ] Severity in case of an incident
  - [ ] Critical - S1
  - [ ] High - S2
  - [ ] Medium - S3
  - [ ] Low - S4
* [ ] Who will be using this data, and where (dashboards, snowflake UI, etc.)?
  - `      `
* [ ] How much data needs to be loaded in the initial run? (All time, 12 months, 24 months lookback etc.) The data team adheres to [data minimization principle](https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/business-technology/data-team/how-we-work/new-data-source/#data-minimisation).
  - `      `
 
* [ ] Please list and describe any data from this source that are confidential (Classified as Red or Orange in our [Data Classification Policy](https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/security/data-classification-standard/#data-classification-levels))?
 - _`{data fields, columns, or objects}`_
* [ ] Please list the exact data elements from this source that would be defined as [Personal Data](https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/legal/privacy/#privacy-terms) and please clarify if Personal Data is required to be extracted Y/N?
 - _`{data fields, columns, or objects}`_
* [ ] Does this data have any agreed [SLO](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/business-technology/data-team/platform/#slos-service-level-objectives-by-data-source) attached to it? If not:
   * [ ] How often does the data need to be refreshed?
 
## People matrix
| Role | Name | Gitlab Handle |
| ---- | ---- | ------------- |
| System owner | `Please provide` | `Please provide` | `Please provide` |

## Integration Preparation
 
<!--
Sufficient access needs to be granted and verified before we can begin working on an automated extraction
--->
 
**Will there need to be access granted in order for a Data Engineer to extract this data? (example: New permissions or credentials to Salesforce in order to access the data)**
 - [ ] Yes
 - [ ] No
 - [ ] I don't know
 
**If Yes:**
- Prioritize giving access to a service account rather than any individual Data Engineer, if uncertain on which account to
use contact the Data Engineer assigned below for confirmation. 
- Where will access be required?
- Link to Access Request: <!-- This can be blank to start, will need to be added for prioritization -->
 
 
## Data Engineer tasks
 
**Triage**
* [ ] Determine the extraction solution via decision [diagram](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/business-technology/data-team/how-we-work/new-data-source/#extraction-solution):
* [ ] Estimate the [issue points](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/business-technology/data-team/how-we-work/#issue-pointing), based on the current information* 
* [ ] This new data source is listed in the [tech_stack.yml](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/www-gitlab-com/-/blob/master/data/tech_stack.yml) and does not have `data_classification: Red`. If the data source does have `data_classification: Red`, the following approvals are required:
    - [ ] BT/Data VP-level
    - [ ] Security (Security Risk Management Officer)
    - [ ] Privacy (Lead Legal Counsel - Privacy)
    - [ ] Not applicable - this data source is already extracted and it concerns extending the current pipeline
* [ ] If it is indicated that the data source contains Personal Data and the data is intended to be extracted, work with our Legal Privacy team to obtain approval:
    - [ ] Legal Privacy (@emccrann).
* [ ] Will the Personal Data to be extracted include "sensitive Personal Data," which is data related to race/ethnicity, health or medical details, biometric or genetic data, religion, political affiliation or philosophy, sexual orientation, criminal offenses, citizenship/immigraion, or trade unions. Sensitive Personal Data may be prohibited from being processed under certain privacy legislation. If checked, the following approvals are required:
    - [ ] Legal Privacy (@emccrann)
    - [ ] People Operations, if sensitive Personal Data is related to Team Members (@mpatel8).
 
**Admin**
 * [ ] Create issue for creation of extract process (not needed if using Stitch/FiveTran)
 * [ ] Create issue for dbt models
 * [ ] Create and link merge requests for updating relevant documentation
 
**Who should be responsible for making the data accessible and usable in the data warehouse?**
- [ ] Analyst: <!-- please tag them -->
- [ ] Analytics Engineer <!-- please tag them -->
- [ ] Data Engineer: <!-- please tag them -->

**Who can we contact in the case of external errors or source freshness problems**
- [ ] Ensure the [data source contact sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1VKvqyn7wy6HqpWS9T3MdPnE6qbfH2kGPQDFg2qPcp6U/edit#gid=0) is updated.
