{% docs bdg_crm_opportunity_contact_role %}

A fact table bridging opportunities with contacts. One opportunity can have multiple contacts and one can be flagged as the primary.

{% enddocs %}

{% docs bdg_epic_user_request %}

A bridge table that connects epics user requests, these epics being in the `Gitlab-org` group, with SFDC Opportunities / Accounts and Zendesk tickets links. It also picks the priorities that have been assigned to the epic request.

This table combines the requests that were done directly in the `Gitlab-org` group by pasting the SFDC / Zendesk links directly in the epic description / notes (`prep_epic_user_request`), with the requests that were done by pasting the epic links in the customer collaboration projects (`prep_epic_user_request_collaboration_project`). If the combination of epic and link is found in both the `Gitlab-org` group and the customer collaboration project, the `Gitlab-org` will take precedence. If the request is only in the customer collaboration project then the flag `is_user_request_only_in_collaboration_project` will be equal to `True`.

{% enddocs %}

{% docs bdg_issue_user_request %}

A bridge table that connects issues user requests, these issues being in the `Gitlab-org` group, with SFDC Opportunities / Accounts and Zendesk tickets links. It also picks the priorities that have been assigned to the issue request.

This table combines the requests that were done directly in the `Gitlab-org` group by pasting the SFDC / Zendesk links directly in the issue description / notes (`prep_issue_user_request`), with the requests that were done by pasting the issue links in the customer collaboration projects (`prep_issue_user_request_collaboration_project`). If the combination of issue and link is found in both the `Gitlab-org` group and the customer collaboration project, the `Gitlab-org` will take precedence. If the request is only in the customer collaboration project then the flag `is_user_request_only_in_collaboration_project` will be equal to `True`.

{% enddocs %}

{% docs bdg_namespace_order_subscription_monthly %}

The purpose of this table is three-fold:
1. Connect **Ultimate Parent** Namespace ID to Subscription (and hence Zuora billing account and CRM Account)
2. Connect Customer DB Customer ID to Subscription for self managed purchases. This helps with marketing efforts.
3. Provide a historical record the above connections by month.

This table expands the functionality of the orders by improving the join to ultimate parent namespaces and subscriptions. Namespaces are listed in this table with prior trials and currently paid plans. Subscriptions listed in this table are all SaaS (determined by the `product_rate_plan_id` from `zuora_rate_plan_source`) and the `is_active_subscription` column can be used to filter to subscription that are currently active (status is Active or Cancelled with a recurring charge in the current month). Orders in this table are all SaaS (determined by the `product_rate_plan_id` from `customers_db_orders_source`) and the `is_active_order` column can be used to filter to orders that are currently active (`order_end_date` is NULL or greater than the date that this table was refreshed).

The tier(s) connected to the subscription are determined using the underlying Zuora recurring charges. This view uses a `FULL OUTER JOIN` to show all three sides of the Venn diagram. (namespace, orders, subscriptions)
In doing so exceptions are noted within `namespace_order_subscription_match_status` to identify rows that do not match between systems.

{% enddocs %}

{% docs bdg_namespace_order_subscription %}

The tier(s) connected to the subscription are determined using the underlying Zuora recurring charges. This view uses a `FULL OUTER JOIN` to show all three parts of the Venn diagram (orders, subscriptions, and the overlap between the two).In doing so exceptions are noted within `order_subscription_match_status` to identify rows that do not match between systems.

{% enddocs %}

{% docs bdg_subscription_product_rate_plan %}

{% docs fct_usage_ci_minutes %}

This table replicates the Gitlab UI logic that generates the CI minutes Usage Quota for both personal namespaces and top level group namespaces. The codebase logic used to build this model can be seen mapped in [this diagram](https://app.lucidchart.com/documents/view/0b8b66e6-8536-4a5d-b992-9e324581187d/0_0).

Namespaces from the `namespace_snapshots_monthly_all` CTE that are not present in the `namespace_statistics_monthly_all` CTE are joined into the logic with NULL `shared_runners_seconds` since these namespaces have not used CI Minutes on GitLab-provided shared runners. Since these CI Minutes are neither trackable nor monetizable, they can be functionally thought of as 0 `shared_runners_minutes_used_overall`. The SQL code has been implemented with this logic as justification.

It also adds two additional columns which aren't calculated in the UI, which are `limit_based_plan` and `status_based_plan` which are independent of whether there aren't projects with `shared_runners_enabled` inside the namespaces and only take into account how many minutes have been used from the monthly quota based in the plan of the namespace.

{% docs fct_event_valid %}

**Description:** Atomic level GitLab.com usage event data with only valid events
- [Targets and Actions](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/api/events.html) activity by Users and [Namespaces](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/business-technology/data-team/data-catalog/namespace/) within the GitLab.com application are captured and refreshed periodically throughout the day.  Targets are objects ie. issue, milestone, merge_request and Actions have effect on Targets, ie. approved, closed, commented, created, etc.

**Data Grain:**
- event_pk

**Filters Applied to Model:**
- Include valid events for standard analysis and reporting:
  - Exclude events where the event created date < the user created date (`days_since_user_creation_at_event_date >= 0`)
    - These are usually events from projects that were created before the GitLab.com user and then imported after the user is created 
  - Exclude events from blocked users (based on the current user state)
- Rolling 36 months of data

**Business Logic in this Model:**
- A namespace's plan information (ex: `plan_name_at_event_date`) is determined by the plan for the last event on a given day
- The ultimate parent namespace's subscription, billing, and account information (ex: `dim_latest_subscription_id`) reflects the most recent available attributes associated with that namespace
- `dim_latest_product_tier_id` reflects the _current_ product tier of the namespace
- Not all events have a user associated with them (ex: 'milestones'), and not all events have a namespace associated with them (ex: 'users_created'). Therefore it is expected that `dim_user_sk` or `dim_ultimate_parent_namespace_id` will be NULL for these events
- `section_name`, `stage_name`, `group_name`, and xMAU metric flags (ex: `is_gmau`) are based on the _current_ event mappings and may not match the mapping at the time of the event

**Other Comments:**
- Note about the `action` event: This "event" captures everything from the [Events API](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/api/events.html) - issue comments, MRs created, etc. While the `action` event is mapped to the Manage stage, the events included actually span multiple stages (plan, create, etc), which is why this is used for UMAU. Be mindful of the impact of including `action` during stage adoption analysis.

{% docs fct_usage_ping_metric_all_time %}
Factual table on the grain of an individual metric received as part of a usage ping payload.  This model specifically includes only metrics that represent usage over the entire lifetime of the instance.

Information on the Enterprise Dimensional Model can be found in the [handbook](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/business-ops/data-team/platform/edw/)

{% enddocs %}

{% docs fct_usage_self_managed_seat_link %}

Self-managed EE instances send [Seat Link](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/subscriptions/self_managed/#seat-link) usage data to [CustomerDot](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com) on a daily basis. This information includes a count of active users and a maximum count of users historically in order to assist the [true up process](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/subscriptions/self_managed/#users-over-license). Counts are reported from the last day of the month for historical months, and the most recent `reported_date` for the current month. Additional details can be found in [this doc](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/blob/staging/doc/reconciliations.md).

Information on the Enterprise Dimensional Model can be found in the [handbook](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/business-ops/data-team/platform/edw/)

{% enddocs %}

{% docs fct_usage_storage %}
This table replicates the Gitlab UI logic that generates the Storage Usage Quotas for top level group namespaces. The logic used to build this model is explained in [this epic](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/4237). The specific front end logic is described [here](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/4237#note_400257377).

Storage usage is reported in bytes in source and this is reflected in the `_size` columns. These sizes are then converted into GiB (1 GiB = 2^30 bytes = 1,073,741,824 bytes), and MiB (1 MiB = 2^20 bytes = 1,048,576 bytes), which is most often displayed in the UI. Since storage limits are allocated in GiB, they were left as such in the `_limit` columns.

Since this table reports at the top level namespace grain, aggregation of the individual underlying repositories is required. To increase visibility of the underlying repositories, two count columns (and their associated flags) are added that aren't calculated in the UI: which are `repositories_above_free_limit_count` and `capped_repositories_count`. These columns can serve as helpful indicators for when a customer will likely need to purchase extra storage.

For the purpose of this table, all child namespaces under a top level namespace with unlimited storage are also assumed to have unlimited storage. Also, storage sizes are converted to MiB and GiB in this table because these are the values being reported under the hood, even though on a project page storage is reported as "MB" or "GB".

{% docs dim_installation %}

Installation dimension, based off of version ping data, version host table, and Seat Link data. The primary key comes from `prep_ping_instance` and `Seat Link` and is built as a surrogate key based off of the `dim_host_id` and the `dim_instance_id`. Importantly, this means that any installation that has never sent a Service Ping or Seat Link record will not appear in this table.

An installtion can change from one delivery/deployment type to another. For example, an installation can start as a Self-Managed installation, but later transition to GitLab Dedicated. In this case, the installation would have multiple valid `product_delivery_type` and `product_deployment_type` values. To account for this, in this model, these fields are [Type 1 Slowly Changing Dimensions](https://www.kimballgroup.com/data-warehouse-business-intelligence-resources/kimball-techniques/dimensional-modeling-techniques/type-1/), meaning that we always populate the field with the most recent value.

{% enddocs %}

{% docs dim_order_action %}

[Order Actions](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/Billing/Subscriptions/Orders/AA_Overview_of_Orders/Order_Actions) are the tasks which can be performed on subscriptions in a single Order (see `dim_order` for more details).

The following actions are supported in the Orders module:

- Create Subscription
- Terms And Conditions
- Renewal
- Cancellation
- Owner Transfer
- Add Product
- Update Product
- Remove Product
- Suspend
- Resume

Multiple order actions can be grouped under a single Order. Previously multiple amendments would have been created to accomplish the same result. Now there can be a single `composite` amendment which encompasses all order actions taken in a single order.

{% docs dim_ping_instance %}

**Description:** Atomic level instance Service Ping data including installation settings and metadata, along with JSON payloads with usage metrics
- Atomic (lowest grain) data with a single record per ping

**Data Grain:**
- dim_ping_instance_id

**Filters Applied to Model:**
- `Inherited` - `uuid IS NOT NULL` (uuid is synonymous with dim_instance_id)
- `Inherited` - `version NOT LIKE '%VERSION%`

**Business Logic in this Model:**
- `is_last_ping_of_month` = last ping created per calendar month per installation (`dim_installation_id`)
- `is_last_ping_of_week` = last ping created per calendar week per installation (`dim_installation_id`)
- `is_internal` = TRUE WHERE:
  - uuid/dim_instance_id = 'ea8bf810-1d6f-4a6a-b4fd-93e8cbd8b57f'
  - (OR) installation_type = 'gitlab-development-kit'
  - (OR) hostname = 'gitlab.com'
  - (OR) hostname LIKE '%.gitlab.com'
- `is_staging` = TRUE WHERE:
  - hostname LIKE 'staging.%'
  - (OR) hostname IN ('staging.gitlab.com','dr.gitlab.com')
- `is_trial` = `IFF(ping_created_at < license_trial_ends_on, TRUE, FALSE)`
- `major_minor_version` = `major_version || '.' || minor_version`
- `app_release_major_minor_id` = `major_version * 100 + minor_version` (helpful for sorting or filtering versions)
- `version_is_prerelease` = `IFF(version ILIKE '%-pre', TRUE, FALSE)`
- `cleaned_edition` = `IFF(license_expires_at >= ping_created_at OR license_expires_at IS NULL, ping_edition, 'EE Free')`

**Other Comments:**
- The `dim_ping_instance` table is built directly from the [prep_ping_instance table](https://gitlab-data.gitlab.io/analytics/#!/model/model.gitlab_snowflake.prep_ping_instance) which brings in Instance Service Ping data one record per Service Ping.  Along with the Instance information a 'Payload' column with an array of Metrics is captured in the Service Ping.
- Sums, Counts and Percents of Usage (called metrics) is captured along with the Implementation Information at the Instance Level and sent to GitLab. The Instance Owner determines whether Service Ping data will be sent or not.
- GitLab implementations can be Customer Hosted (Self-Managed), GitLab Hosted (referred to as SaaS or Dotcom data) or GitLab Dedicated Hosted (where each Installation is Hosted by GitLab but on Separate Servers).  
- `dim_ping_instance_id` is the unique identifier for the service ping and is synonymous with `id` in the source data
- `dim_instance_id` is synonymous with `uuid` in the source data
- `dim_installation_id` is the unique identifier for the actual installation. It is a combination of `dim_instance_id` and `dim_host_id`. `dim_host_id` is required because there can be multiple installations that share the same `dim_instance_id` (ex: gitlab.com has several installations sharing the same dim_instance_id: gitlab.com, staging.gitlab.com, etc)
- Multiple Instances can be hosted on each Implementation. Multiple Installations can be included within each Instance which is determined by Host_id. (Instance_id || Host_id = Installation_id)
- Service Ping data is captured at a particular point in time with `all-time, 7_day and 28_day` metrics.  The metrics are only pertinent to the Ping Date and Time and can not be aggregated across Ping Dates. Service Pings are normally compared WoW, MoM, YoY,  etc.  
- The different types of Service Pings are shown here with the [Self-Managed Service Ping](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/business-technology/data-team/data-catalog/saas-service-ping-automation/#self-managed-service-ping), [GitLab Hosted Implementation](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/business-technology/data-team/data-catalog/saas-service-ping-automation/#saas-service-ping).
- [GitLab Dedicated Implementation](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/subscriptions/gitlab_dedicated/#gitlab-dedicated) service pings will function similar to Self-Managed Implementations.
- [Service Ping Guide](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/service_ping/) shows a technical overview of the Service Ping data flow.

**Description:** Monthly performance indicator targets, based on the dates and targets provided in [performance indicator .yml files](https://gitlab.com/internal-handbook/internal-handbook.gitlab.io/-/tree/main/data/performance_indicators). This model is used to generate target values in the `[td_xmau]` and other related snippets.

**Data Grain:**
- reporting_month
- pi_metric_name

**Filters Applied to Model:**
- Use currently valid records from files - `valid_to_date = MAX(valid_to_date)`
- Include metrics with targets - `pi_monthly_estimated_targets IS NOT NULL` (field from .yml file)

**Business Logic in this Model:**
- `reporting_month` is derived from the date provided in the `pi_monthly_estimated_targets` field of the .yml file
  - Target end date: date specified in `pi_monthly_estimated_targets`
  - Target start date: The day after the previous target end date _OR_, if a previous target is not specified, `2020-03-01` (date of earliest PIs we are tracking)

Example: `pi_monthly_estimated_targets`: `{"2022-02-28":1000,"2022-03-31":2000,"2022-05-31":3000}`

| reporting_month | target_value |
| --- | --- |
| 2020-03-01 | 1000 |
| ... | 1000 |
| 2022-02-01 | 1000 |
| 2022-03-01 | 2000 |
| 2022-04-01 | 3000 |
| 2022-05-01 | 3000 |

{% docs fct_ping_instance_metric %}

**Description:** Atomic level instance Service Ping data by ping and metric for all metrics, including basic identifiers for easy joins out to dimension tables
- The data includes a single row per ping and metric
- Includes installation, instance, date, product, billing, and subscription identifiers

**Data Grain:**
- dim_ping_instance_id
- metrics_path

**Filters Applied to Model:**
- `Inherited` - `uuid IS NOT NULL` (uuid is synonymous with dim_instance_id)
- `Inherited` - `version NOT LIKE '%VERSION%`

**Business Logic in this Model:**
- Includes all metrics, regardless of time frame or whether they can be located in `dim_ping_metric`
- `Inherited` - `has_timed_out` = `IFF(value = -1, TRUE, FALSE)`
- `Inherited` - Metrics that timed out (return -1) are set to a value of 0
- `Inherited` - `umau_value` = metric value from `usage_activity_by_stage_monthly.manage.events`
- `dim_subscription_id` = `COALESCE(prep_subscription.dim_subscription_id, ping_payload.license_subscription_id)`

**Other Comments:**
- The `fct_ping_instance_metric` table is built directly from the [prep_ping_instance table](https://gitlab-data.gitlab.io/analytics/#!/model/model.gitlab_snowflake.prep_ping_instance) which brings in Instance Service Ping data one record per Service Ping.  Along with the Instance information a 'Payload' column with an array of Metrics is captured in the Service Ping.
- Sums, Counts and Percents of Usage (called metrics) is captured along with the Implementation Information at the Instance Level and sent to GitLab. The Instance Owner determines whether Service Ping data will be sent or not.
- GitLab implementations can be Customer Hosted (Self-Managed), GitLab Hosted (referred to as SaaS or Dotcom data) or GitLab Dedicated Hosted (where each Installation is Hosted by GitLab but on Separate Servers).  
- `dim_ping_instance_id` is the unique identifier for the service ping and is synonymous with `id` in the source data
- `dim_instance_id` is synonymous with `uuid` in the source data
- `dim_installation_id` is the unique identifier for the actual installation. It is a combination of `dim_instance_id` and `dim_host_id`. `dim_host_id` is required because there can be multiple installations that share the same `dim_instance_id` (ex: gitlab.com has several installations sharing the same dim_instance_id: gitlab.com, staging.gitlab.com, etc)
- Multiple Instances can be hosted on each Implementation. Multiple Installations can be included within each Instance which is determined by Host_id. (Instance_id || Host_id = Installation_id)
- Service Ping data is captured at a particular point in time with `all-time, 7_day and 28_day` metrics.  The metrics are only pertinent to the Ping Date and Time and can not be aggregated across Ping Dates. Service Pings are normally compared WoW, MoM, YoY,  etc.  
- The different types of Service Pings are shown here with the [Self-Managed Service Ping](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/business-technology/data-team/data-catalog/saas-service-ping-automation/#self-managed-service-ping), [GitLab Hosted Implementation](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/business-technology/data-team/data-catalog/saas-service-ping-automation/#saas-service-ping).

The purpose of this data model is to identify the service pings, from Self-Managed and SaaS Dedicated, that can be mapped to a subscription and to pivot thet set of [wave metrics required for Gainsight](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-data/analytics/-/blob/master/transform/snowflake-dbt/macros/version/ping_instance_wave_metrics.sql) from the `fct_ping_instance_metric` model, strip all the sensitive data out, and then report one value for each metric in that column.

{% enddocs %}


{% docs fct_ping_instance_metric_wave_monthly %}

This table builds on the set of all Zuora subscriptions that are associated with **Self-Managed**  or **SaaS Dedicated** rate plans. Seat Link data from Customers DB (`fct_usage_self_managed_seat_link`) are combined with high priority Usage Ping metrics (`fct_ping_instance_metric_wave`) to build out the set of facts included in this table.

The grain of this table is `hostname` per `dim_instance_id(uuid)` per `dim_subscription_id` per `snapshot_month`. Since there are Self-Managed subscriptions that do not send Usage Ping payloads, it is possible for `dim_instance_id` and `hostname` to be null.

The data from this table will be used to create a mart tables -  `mart_product_usage_paid_user_metrics_monthly` and `mart_product_usage_wave_1_3_metrics_monthly_diff` for Gainsight Customer Product Insights.

{% docs bdg_metrics_redis_events %}
## Overview
This model records the many-to-many relationship between Service Ping Metrics, internal events, and internal event filters.
The grain is one record per metric, event, and filter. It pulls from the metrics dictionary yml files via `dim_ping_metric`, and contains the
metric name, and the internal event name. It will be joined to Snowplow events that contain the Service Ping Context to get Gitlab.com product usage data at the namespace level.

## Aggregation Strategies
[This thread](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/376244#note_1167575425) has a nice summary of the possible aggregation strategies. The important thing to know from an analyst perspective is that internal events metrics come in three basic varities:
1. Have only one associated internal event; if that event occurs, count the metric
1. Have multiple associated internal events; count the metric if _any_ internal event in that list occurs
1. Have multiple associated internal events; count the metric if _all_ internal events in that list occur

As a result, this bridge table will be used a bit differently to count intersection metrics compared to how it will be used to count union metrics.

{% docs fct_behavior_unstructured_event %}

**Description:** Fact table containing quantitative data for both staging and non-staging snowplow unstructured events. These events include [Snowplow-authored "out of the box" events](https://docs.snowplow.io/docs/understanding-tracking-design/out-of-the-box-vs-custom-events-and-entities/#snowplow-authored-events) like `link_click`, `focus_form`, `change_form`, and `submit_form`. Unstructured event data is based on a JSON schema.

**Data Grain:** fct_behavior_unstructured_sk (generated in [prep_snowplow_unnested_events_all](https://dbt.gitlabdata.com/#!/model/model.gitlab_snowflake.prep_snowplow_unnested_events_all))
- event_id
- behavior_at

**Filters Applied to Model:**
- Include unstructured events (`event = 'unstruct'`) 

**Business Logic in this Model:**
- A selection of key value pairs from Snowplow-authored events are parsed out into their own columns:
  - `link_click`: target URL
  - `submit_form`: form ID
  - `change_form`: form ID, form type, form element ID
  - `focus_form`: form element ID, form node name

**Other Comments:**
- Any self-describing event (ex. not a structured event, page view, etc) is considered to be "unstructured", but GitLab's current instrumentation focuses on the [Snowplow-authored "out of the box" events](https://docs.snowplow.io/docs/understanding-tracking-design/out-of-the-box-vs-custom-events-and-entities/#snowplow-authored-events).

{% docs fct_event_namespace_monthly %}

**Description:** GitLab.com usage event data for valid events, grouped by month, event name, and ultimate parent namespace

**Data Grain:**
- event_calendar_month
- event_name
- dim_ultimate_parent_namespace_id

**Filters Applied to Model:**
- Exclude events not associated with a namespace (ex: 'users_created')
- `Inherited` - Include valid events for standard analysis and reporting:
  - Exclude events where the event created date < the user created date (`days_since_user_creation_at_event_date >= 0`)
    - These are usually events from projects that were created before the GitLab.com user and then imported after the user is created 
  - Exclude events from blocked users (based on the current user state)
- `Inherited` - Rolling 36 months of data

**Business Logic in this Model:**
- `Inherited` - A namespace's plan information (ex: `plan_name_at_event_month`) is determined by the plan for the last event on a given month
- `Inherited` - The ultimate parent namespace's subscription, billing, and account information (ex: `dim_latest_subscription_id`) reflects the most recent available attributes associated with that namespace
- `Inherited` - `dim_latest_product_tier_id` reflects the _current_ product tier of the namespace
- `Inherited` - `section_name`, `stage_name`, `group_name`, and xMAU metric flags (ex: `is_gmau`) are based on the _current_ event mappings and may not match the mapping at the time of the event

**Other Comments:**
- The current month is _included_ in this model. Be mindful of potentially including incomplete data
- Note about the `action` event: This "event" captures everything from the [Events API](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/api/events.html) - issue comments, MRs created, etc. While the `action` event is mapped to the Manage stage, the events included actually span multiple stages (plan, create, etc), which is why this is used for UMAU. Be mindful of the impact of including `action` during stage adoption analysis.

{% docs fct_delta_arr_subscription_lineage_product_monthly %}

Delta ARR is a measure of changes to ARR compared to the prior month. The [ARR Analysis Framework](https://internal-handbook.gitlab.io/handbook/sales/annual-recurring-revenue-arr/#arr-analysis-framework) handbook page provides more details on the analysis.

The model uses the subscription_lineage grain to calculate the Delta ARR. This is a fundamental change from previous Delta ARR models at the subscription grain. When looking at the subscription grain, debook-book scenarios are not captured. Therefore, it is necessary to analyze the subscription_lineage grain for accurate product level Delta ARR changes. This model provides a method to analyze the 6 subscription linkage scenarios provided in this [Linking Subscriptions for Data Retention](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1SYFy0Xqau1dbOm2YXmp0NvWDEkL_vIcWaFhKzwcocCM/edit#gid=0) file.

The model ERD can be found [HERE](https://lucid.app/lucidchart/invitations/accept/inv_07d25d39-3076-408f-b768-67d1895ea064). 

Model Validation:

The model ties out 100% to mart_arr with the below 3 exceptions:

1. The model removes subscriptions with data quality problems in the subscription_name_slugify field that is used for the subscription lineage. These were 5 subscriptions at the time of model creation and they do not have a material impact on the model insights.

1. The model removes Storage product charges. The model is intended to focus on the paid plan tiers only.

1. At the time of model creation, there were 23 subscriptions that were part of lineages where subscriptions in the lineage roll up to different Salesforce ultimate parent accounts. All of the ARR for these subscriptions is in the model; however, the model rolls up the ARR for these subscriptions to the ultimate parent account of the oldest subscription in the lineage. This results in these 23 parent accounts not tieing out 100% to mart_arr.

Model Caveat:

1. It should be that a subscription only has 1 paid tier plan attached to it. However, there are a small minority of subscriptions that have more than 1 product. Therefore, it is necessary to put the product tiers into an array in the model for completeness. In virtually all cases, it is 2 product tiers on the subscription with many of them having old Bronze/Starter plans in addition to Premium plans.

{% docs dim_team_member %}

This table contains team members work and personal information. Sensitive columns are masked and only visible by team members with the analyst_people role assigned in Snowflake. The table includes information regarding current team members, new hires who have records created in Workday before their start date and team members who were terminated in 2021 onwards. Team members who were terminated before 2021 are not captured in this model at this time. The grain of this table is one row per employee_id per valid_to/valid_from combination.

{% enddocs %}

{% docs fct_team_member_position %}

This table contains team members' job history, including any changes in their job profile or team. The table joins the staffing_history_approved_source and job_profiles_source. The grain of this table is one row per employee_id, team_id, effective_date and date_time_initiated combination. 

The reason why the date and time when the change was initiated was added to the grain is because there are changes that are scheduled to take effect on the same date. In order to make sure that we capture the most up-to-date change and ensure the records are unique, we need to add take this timestamp into account.

{% enddocs %}

{% docs fct_team_member_status %}

This table contains the termination reason, type, exit impact and employment_status. Sensitive columns are masked and only visible by team members with the analyst_people role assigned in Snowflake. This table contains only past terminations. Future terminations are not included at this time. We will evaluate the possibility of making future terminations available to people with the analyst_people role in a future iteration. The grain of this table is one row per employee_id, employment_status and status_effective_date combination.

{% enddocs %}

{% docs fct_team_status %}

This table is a derived fact from fct_team_member_status and fct_team_member_position. Sensitive columns are masked and only visible by team members with the analyst_people role assigned in Snowflake.

This table only contains one change in the team member's position per effective date, as opposed to the fct_team_member_position table which contains all changes to a team member's position profile, regardless of whether they became effective or not. This table doesn't include future hires, only people working at GitLab as of today's date.

{% docs dim_trial_latest %}

This table summarizes all the trial Orders information for a specific namespace.

We utilize the `customers_db_orders_snapshots_base` model in order to isolate/filter out all the trials. 

This model does the following:

* It isolates the orders that are flagged with the column `is_trial = TRUE`
* It deduplicates by taking the latest row created for a specific `gitlab_namespace_id`
* We can join this model with `customers_db_customers` in the downstream models in order to get information about country, company_size of the User who started the trial

{% enddocs %}


{% docs fct_trial %}

This model collects all trials that start from the subscription portal. For this we use the `customers_db_orders_snapshots_base` model in order to isolate them. This model does the following:

* It isolates the orders that are flagged with the column `is_trial = TRUE`
* It joins with customers, users and namespaces. 

Finally, this model identifies if a trial has been converted or not. To achieve that, we join the trials to the `order_snapshots` by selecting only the orders that converted to subscription after the trial starting date (an example has been provided below). We exclude ci_minutes/compute_minutes orders from the `order_snapshots`.   

In order to identify which subscriptions are actually valid and not refunded, we join to `zuora_rate_plan` and `zuora_base_mrr` models to filter out subscriptions that have (mrr <= 0 and tcv <=0). In this case, we also filter out those subscriptions that are cancelled instantly or fully refunded after a certain period.

Examples:

| ORDER_ID | ORDER_UPDATED_AT        | ORDER_START_DATE  | ORDER_END_DATE | ORDER_IS_TRIAL | SUBSCRIPTION_NAME_SLUGIFY |

Note: The column `subscription_name_slugify` has been anonymised.

This order exemplifies perfectly what is happening in the table `customers_db_orders`. When the order starts, 17th Aug, 2019, it is a trial. That means that the flag `order_is_trial` is set to TRUE. But it doesn't have either a subscription_id or a subscription_name (`subscription_name_slugify` is null). When it converts, 2nd Nov, 2019, the `order_is_trial` flag is set to `FALSE`, the order_start_date (and order_end_date) is changed and a `subscription_name` and `subscription_id` are set! (last row of the table)


{% enddocs %}

{% docs fct_trial_first %}

This model is a derived fact table that is built using the `fct_trial` model, which contains all trial orders that start from the subscription portal. This model additionally deduplicates by taking the first row that was created for customers, namespaces and users based on the `order_updated_at` column. 

The grain of this model is `trial order per namespace`. 

This model identifies if a trial order has been converted or not. We exclude ci_minutes/compute_minutes orders from this model. 

Finally, only valid subscriptions that are not refunded are identified by filtering out subscriptions that have (mrr <= 0 and tcv <=0). The subscriptions that are cancelled instantly or fully refunded after a certain period are excluded. 

The `customers_db_orders_snapshots_base` model has reliable data from the 1st of September, 2019, therefore only the orders that have a `start_date` after this date are included this model.


{% enddocs %}


{% docs fct_trial_latest %}

This model captures information about the latest trial Orders for a specific namespace. 

The grain of this model is `trial order per namespace`.

## Context

To understand the context, the following information is important:
* Before 2019-09-16, a namespace could subscribe to a trial several times. That was a bug corrected by the fulfillment team in September 2019. More info [here](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/merge_requests/458).
* All snapshots tables have also been created in September 2019. Before that we don't have historical information.
* The Customers_db ETL was unstable before October 2019. We improved the logic at the end of October by changing from incremental model to a daily full "drop and create" to the raw database.

## Process

Trial Information is collected in 2 tables (one in the subscription portal database - customer_db, the other in the .com database - main app). These 2 tables don't talk to each other and have incomplete information. We join them together to create a more consistent and complete picture of trials started.

For the gitlab_dotcom database, information is stored in `gitlab_dotcom_gitlab_subscriptions` table. As described [here](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-data/analytics/merge_requests/1983#note_249268694), rows can be deleted in this table, so we use the `gitlab_dotcom_gitlab_subscriptions_snapshot` for higher reporting accuracy.  In this model, we do the following operations:
* We isolate trials by looking at a specific column `gitlab_subscription_trial_ends_on` which is filled only when a specific subscription was a trial before.
* We then group by the namespace_id in order to only select the latest trials started for a specific namespace.
* One weird behaviour of this table is the way it deals with expired orders. It is explained [here](/model.gitlab_snowflake.gitlab_dotcom_gitlab_subscriptions). That means that the `start_date` is NOT a reliable source for us in order to find the trial start date. We therefore use the `gitlab_subscription_trial_ends_on` column in order to estimate when the trial has been started (30 days before the end of the trials in most cases)

The data for latest trial per namespace is derived from `fct_trial` model. We then join the 2 CTEs created on `gitlab_namespace_id`.

This model identifies if a trial has been converted or not. The logic for which has been included in `fct_trial` model. We exclude ci_minutes orders from this model.   

Finally, only valid subscriptions that are not refunded are identified by filtering out subscriptions that have (mrr <= 0 and tcv <=0). The subscriptions that are cancelled instantly or fully refunded after a certain period are excluded.

{% docs dim_snippet %}

[Snippets](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/snippets.html) are pieces of code which can be stored and shared with others on GitLab. This model stores dimensional attributes about snippets including:

  - Author
  - Project
  - Ultimate Namespace
  - Plan
  - Type (project/personal)
  - Created Date
  - Updated Date

{% enddocs %}

{% docs dim_package %}

Customers can publish and share packages in using GitLab's [package registry](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/packages/package_registry/). This models contains dimensional attributes relating to the packages in the package registry.

{% enddocs %}

{% docs dim_integration %}

A dimensional model describing the integration associated with GitLab namespaces.

From the GitLab.com [documentation](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/integrations/), we know integrations are like plugins, which give customers the freedom to add functionality to GitLab.

{% enddocs %}

{% docs dim_requirement %}

As described in the [GitLab documentation](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/requirements/):

With requirements, you can set criteria to check your products against. They can be based on users, stakeholders, system, software, or anything else you find important to capture. A requirement is an artifact in GitLab which describes the specific behavior of your product. Requirements are long-lived and don’t disappear unless manually cleared.

This dimension model holds all requirement records and provides dimensional data around their state, creation dates, etc.

{% enddocs %}

{% docs fct_crm_opportunity_7th_day_weekly_snapshot %}

Derived fact table from `fct_crm_opportunity_daily_snapshot`. This new table will not include every daily snapshot.  Instead, it will feature a snapshot once every week — specifically, one snapshot every 7 days throughout each quarter. This approach is designed to observe and analyze the key trends and activities occurring each week within the quarter.

{% enddocs %}

{% docs fct_crm_opportunity_7th_day_weekly_snapshot_aggregate %}
   
Derived fact table from `fct_crm_opportunity_daily_snapshot`. This new table will not include every daily snapshot.  Instead, it will feature a snapshot once every week — specifically, one snapshot every 7 days throughout each quarter.

This query aggregates key sales metrics and attributes from the actuals table to the weekly grain and across multiple dimensions like sales source, order type, hierarchy, stage, deal path. This table also computes quarterly totals and adds them as non additive measures to each row, to facilitate pipeline velocity and coverage calculation in Tableau. 

{% enddocs %}

{% docs fct_targets_actuals_7th_day_weekly_snapshot %}
   
Derived fact table from `fct_crm_opportunity_daily_snapshot` and `fct_sales_funnel_target_daily`. This fct table simplifies tracking sales performance by showing targets and actuals combined, every seven days within a quarter. 

It combines daily targets, daily actuals along with the total quarterly targets and actuals. This model includes both the numerator and denominator for calculating coverage throughout a quarter
