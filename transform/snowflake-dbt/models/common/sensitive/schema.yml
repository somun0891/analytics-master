    description: >-
      This table contains information of the marketing contact (email address) and namespace information for Gitlab.com users. The grain of the table is one row per email address, the namespace details are then stored in an array
      of JSON objects.
      Only the ultimate parent namespaces are being synced into the namespace details array. If an user has access only to a subgroup of a ultimate parent namespace, the ultimate namespace is not linked to the ultimate namespace.
      For example, user A is a member of the sub group namespace 2. The ultimate parent namespace of namespace 2 is namespace 1. Since user A is only a direct member of namespace 2 and namespace 2 is not an ultimate namespace,
      user A has no namespaces listed in the namespace array list.
