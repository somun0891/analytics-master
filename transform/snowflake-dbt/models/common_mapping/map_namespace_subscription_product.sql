how the charges track the history of the subscription. To map between the current dim_subscription_id and the one active at the time of the charges, we join to the subscription object 
between the subscription_created_datetime (adjusted for the first version of a subscription due to backdated effective dates in subscriptions) and the created date of the next subscription version.
