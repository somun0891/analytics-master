{% docs map_moved_duplicated_issue %}

Table mapping issues to the latest issue they were moved and / or duplicated to.

Example:

`Issue A` is moved to `Issue B`, `Issue B` is closed as duplicate of `Issue C`, `Issue C` is moved to `Issue D`

Then in our mapping table we would have:

| issue_id | last_moved_duplicated_issue_id | dim_issue_sk |
| -- | -- | -- |
| Issue A | Issue D | Surrogate Key for Issue D |
| Issue B | Issue D | Surrogate Key for Issue D |
| Issue C | Issue D | Surrogate Key for Issue D |
| Issue D | Issue D | Surrogate Key for Issue D |

{% docs map_subscription_opportunity %}

The distinct combination of subscriptions and opportunities generated through the rules defined in `prep_subscription_opportunity_mapping`. A flag has been created to indicate the subscription-opportunty mappings filled in by taking the most recent opportunity_id associated with a version of the subscription with the same subscription_name which we believe to have the lowest level of fidelity.

{% docs map_latest_subscription_namespace_monthly %}

This table contains the most recent subscription version associated with each namespace in each month, and represents the most complete namespace <> subscription mapping we have. It prefers the Zuora namespace <> subscription mappings, then fills in any nulls with bridge logic. The end objective is to backfill Zuora with all mappings so that `dim_subscription` can be the SSOT for namespace <> subscription relationships.

Although in the prep data, namespaces can be associated with multiple `dim_subscription_id`s and/or multiple `dim_subscription_id_original`s in a single month, we use a `QUALIFY` statement in this table to limit down to **one** subscription per namespace per month (the most recently created subscription).
