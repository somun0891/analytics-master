{% docs rpt_event_xmau_metric_monthly %}

**Description:** GitLab.com xMAU metrics by month and user group (total, free, paid), sourced from the gitlab.com db replica. 
This model is used for xMAU/PI reporting and is the source for paid GitLab.com xMAU in the `[td_xmau]` snippet.

**Data Grain:**
- event_calendar_month
- user_group
- event_name_array

**Filters Applied to Model:**
- Include events that occurred on the last 28 days of the calendar month
- Include events used in xMAU reporting (SMAU, GMAU, UMAU)
- Exclude events not associated with a user (`is_null_user = FALSE`) 
- Exclude the current month
- `Inherited` - Include valid events for standard analysis and reporting:
  - Remove Events where the Event Created Datetime < the User Created Datetime.
    - These are usually events from projects that were created before the User and then imported in by the User after the User is created.  
  - Remove Events from blocked users
- `Inherited` - Rolling 24mos of Data

**Business Logic in this Model:** 
- The Last Plan Id of the Month for the Namespace is used for the `user_group` attribution
- Usage is aggregated by xMAU metric instead of `event_name`. Metrics spanning multiple events are aggregated and deduped for ease of reporting. See `event_name_array` for all events included in the metric.
- `group_name` is NULL if the metric spans events associated with multiple groups. (This is necessary for the metrics to aggregate properly)
- `stage_name` is NULL for UMAU events
- Aggregated Counts are based on the Event Date being within the Last Day of the Month and 27 days prior to the Last Day of the Month (total 28 days)
  - Events that are 29,30 or 31 days prior to the Last Day of the Month will Not be included in these totals
  - This is intended to match the installation-level Service Ping metrics by getting a 28-day count

**Other Comments:**
- The [Definitive Guide to xMAU Analysis](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/business-technology/data-team/data-catalog/xmau-analysis/) contains additional information about xMAU reporting
- Not all stages are captured in the model. This is due to limitations in replicating Service Ping counters using the gitlab.com db Postgres replica

{% enddocs %}

{% docs rpt_event_plan_monthly %}

**Description:** GitLab.com (SaaS) usage by event, plan, and month, sourced from the gitlab.com db replica.

**Data Grain:**
- event_calendar_month
- plan_id_at_event_month
- plan_name_at_event_month
- event_name

**Filters Applied to Model:**
- Include events that occurred on the last 28 days of the calendar month
- Exclude the current month
- `Inherited` - Include valid events for standard analysis and reporting:
  - Remove Events where the Event Created Datetime < the User Created Datetime.
    - These are usually events from projects that were created before the User and then imported in by the User after the User is created.  
  - Remove Events from blocked users
  - Include events where `dim_user_id IS NULL`. These do not point to a particular User, ie. 'milestones'
- `Inherited` - Rolling 24mos of Data

**Business Logic in this Model:** 
- The Last Plan Id of the Month for the Namespace is used for the `plan_id_at_event_month` attribution
- Similarly, The Last Plan Name of the Month for the Namespace is used for the `plan_name_at_event_month` attribution
- Usage is aggregated by `event_name`, meaning you cannot dedupe user or namespace counts across multiple events using this model.
  - Since some xMAU metrics aggregate across multiple events, use [`rpt_event_xmau_metric_monthly`](https://dbt.gitlabdata.com/#!/model/model.gitlab_snowflake.rpt_event_xmau_metric_monthly) for xMAU reporting
- Not all events have a user associated with them (ex: 'milestones'), and not all events have a namespace associated with them (ex: 'users_created'). Therefore it is expected that `user_count = 0` or `ultimate_parent_namespace_count = 0` for these events.
- Aggregated Counts are based on the Event Date being within the Last Day of the Month and 27 days prior to the Last Day of the Month (total 28 days)
  - Events that are 29,30 or 31 days prior to the Last Day of the Month will Not be included in these totals
  - This is intended to match the installation-level Service Ping metrics by getting a 28-day count

**Other Comments:**
- Note about the `action` event: This "event" captures everything from the [Events API](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/api/events.html) - issue comments, MRs created, etc. While the `action` event is mapped to the Manage stage, the events included actually span multiple stages (plan, create, etc), which is why this is used for UMAU. Be mindful of the impact of including `action` during stage adoption analysis.

{% enddocs %}

{% docs rpt_ping_metric_first_last_versions %}

**Description:** First and last versions of GitLab that a Service Ping metric appeared on a Self-Managed installation by Edition and Prerelease. For xMAU/PI reporting, this model is used to determine the version in which a metric was introduced.
- This table provides First and Last Application Versions along with Installation Counts by Metric, Ping Edition and Prerelease.

**Data Grain:**
- metrics_path
- ping_edition
- version_is_prerelease

**Filters Applied to Model:**
- Exclude GitLab.com (SaaS) Service Pings
- Include metrics appearing on valid versions (those found in `dim_gitlab_releases`)
- `Inherited` - Include 28 Day and All-Time metrics  
- `Inherited` - Include metrics from the 'Last Ping of the Month' pings 

**Business Logic in this Model:** 
- `First Versions` - The earliest (minimum) version found for each metrics_path, ping_edition, and version_is_prerelease
- `Last Versions` - The latest (maximum/most recent) version found for each metrics_path, ping_edition, and version_is_prerelease
- `major_minor_version_id` = major_version * 100 + minor_version
- `version_is_prerelease` = version LIKE '%-pre'

**Tips for Use:**
- In the _vast_ majority of use cases, pre-release versions (`version_is_prerelease = TRUE`) can add more confusion than benefit. It is highly recommended to exclude those records during analysis.
- This model can easily be joined to [`dim_ping_metric`](https://dbt.gitlabdata.com/#!/model/model.gitlab_snowflake.dim_ping_metric) in order to get additional attributes about the metric (`time_frame`, `group_name`, `is_smau`, etc)
- This model can easily be joined to [`dim_gitlab_releases`](https://dbt.gitlabdata.com/#!/model/model.gitlab_snowflake.dim_gitlab_releases) to get the release date for a version

Example query

```
SELECT
  stage_name,
  rpt_ping_metric_first_last_versions.metrics_path,
  ping_edition,
  first_major_minor_version_with_counter,
  release_date AS first_major_minor_version_release_date
FROM common_mart_product.rpt_ping_metric_first_last_versions
JOIN common.dim_ping_metric
  ON rpt_ping_metric_first_last_versions.metrics_path = dim_ping_metric.metrics_path
JOIN common.dim_gitlab_releases
  ON rpt_ping_metric_first_last_versions.first_major_minor_version_with_counter = dim_gitlab_releases.major_minor_version
WHERE version_is_prerelease = FALSE
  AND is_smau = TRUE
ORDER BY 1,2,3
;
```

**Other Comments:**
- Metrics can be introduced on different versions for CE and EE.
- The `milestone` field of the [metrics dictionary](https://metrics.gitlab.com/) can also be used to identify the version when a metric was instrumented, but there are a couple of limitations. First, many metrics are just labeled `< 13.9`, so there is a lack of more detail for older metrics. Second, since metrics can be introduced on different versions for CE and EE, `milestone` could be incorrect for one edition/distribution.
- First/last version is dependent on the metric appearing in a Service Ping payload. There are cases where this value is incorrect due to installations somehow sending the metrics from previous versions, but there is no other complete SSOT for when a metric was introduced.

{% enddocs %}

{% docs rpt_ping_latest_subscriptions_monthly %}

**Description:** Self-Managed and SaaS Dedicated subscriptions by month and installation (if the subscription sent a ping that month). For xMAU/PI reporting, this model is used to determine the total number of active Self-Managed/Dedicated subscriptions on a given month and what percent of subscriptions sent a ping from a given version. It can also be used to determine what percent of subscriptions sent a ping on a given month, etc. 
- The version an installation is reporting on (major_minor_version_id), seat count (licensed_user_count), and count of pings sent that month (ping_count) are also included
- Unpaid subscriptions (ex: OSS, EDU) are _included_ in this model

**Data Grain:**
- ping_created_date_month
- latest_subscription_id
- dim_installation_id (only populated if subscription sent a ping that month)

_Important caveat:_ The grain of this model is slightly different depending on whether a subscription sent a ping that month. It is advised to look at the `MAX()` value, grouped by `latest_subscription_id`.
- If a subscription sent a ping that month, there is 1 record per subscription per installation reporting. (Note: a subscription can be associated with > 1 installation, so a single subscription could have multiple records for a given month)
- If a subscription did not send a ping that month, there is 1 record per subscription where `dim_installation_id IS NULL`

Example query

```
WITH subscription_level AS (

  SELECT
    ping_created_date_month,
    latest_subscription_id,
    COUNT(dim_installation_id) AS installation_count,
    MAX(has_sent_pings) AS has_sent_pings,
    MAX(licensed_user_count) AS seat_count
  FROM common_mart_product.rpt_ping_latest_subscriptions_monthly
  GROUP BY 1,2

)

SELECT
  ping_created_date_month,
  COUNT(latest_subscription_id) AS subscription_count,
  COUNT(IFF(has_sent_pings = TRUE, latest_subscription_id, NULL)) AS sent_ping_count,
  DIV0(sent_ping_count, subscription_count) AS subscription_ping_opt_in_rate
FROM subscription_level
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 1
;
```

**Filters Applied to Model:**
- Include subscriptions where:
  - `product_deployment_type IN ('Self-Managed', 'Dedicated')`
  - `subscription_status IN ('Active','Cancelled')`
  - `product_tier_name NOT IN ('Storage', 'Not Applicable')`
- `major_minor_version_id`, `version_is_prerelease`, and `instance_user_count` look at 'Last Ping of the Month' pings
- Exclude the current month

**Business Logic in this Model:**
- If a ping is received from an installation with a license mapped to a subscription but no corresponding record is found in `fct_charge`, a record is still included in the model where `is_missing_charge_subscription = FALSE`. In this case, the most recent record available in `fct_charge` is used to determine the number of seats associated with the subscription.
- For a given month, all records associated with a subscription will have the same seat count (`licensed_user_count`) since that value is tied to the subscription, not an installation

{% enddocs %}

{% docs rpt_ping_metric_totals_w_estimates_monthly %}

**Description:** Total, recorded, and estimated usage for Self-Managed and SaaS Service Ping metrics. This model is used for xMAU/PI reporting and is the source for Service Ping data in the `[td_xmau]` snippet. You can read more about our estimation methodology on [this handbook page](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/business-technology/data-team/data-catalog/xmau-analysis/estimation-xmau-algorithm.html)

- `Inherited` - Include metrics for 28 Day and All-Time time frames
- `Inherited` - Include metrics from the 'Last Ping of the Month' pings
- `Inherited` - Exclude metrics that timed out during ping generation
- `Inherited` - Exclude the current month

**Business Logic in this Model:**
- `estimation_grain` - tells which method is used to measure the `percent_reporting` %:
  - `metric/version check - subscription based estimation` looks at how many subscriptions sent a ping from a version of GitLab with the metric instrumented (_this is the "official" methodology used for xMAU/PI reporting_)

  - `reported metric - subscription based estimation` looks at how subscriptions reported the metric
  - `reported metric - seat based estimation` looks at how many seats are associated with subscriptions that reported the metric
  - `SaaS` looks at recorded SaaS/gitlab.com usage, there is no additional estimation logic
- `percent_reporting` is defined as `reporting_count / (reporting_count + not_reporting_count)`
- `reporting_count` and `not_reporting_count` are defined by the `estimation_grain` (either count of subscriptions or count of seats)
- For a given month, metric, deployment, edition, and grain, `percent_reporting`, `reporting_count`, and `not_reporting_count` is the same across all tiers

**Tips for Use:**
- The "official" estimation_grain is `metric/version check - subscription based estimation`
- The estimation_grain for SaaS is `SaaS`. Therefore, to pull in the values used for xMAU/PI reporting, you want to use the filter `estimation_grain IN ('metric/version check - subscription based estimation', 'SaaS')`

- Service Ping data is Sums, Counts and Percents of Usage (called metrics) along with the Server Instance Configuration information is collected at a point in time for each Instance and sent to GitLab Corporate.  This is normally done on a weekly basis.  The Instance Owner determines whether this data will be sent or not and how much will be sent.  Implementations can be Customer Hosted (Self-Managed) or GitLab Hosted (referred to as SaaS or Dotcom data).  Multiple Instances can be hosted on Self-Managed Implementations like GitLab Implementations.

- `Inherited` - Include 28 Day and All-Time metrics  
- `Inherited` - Include Metrics from the 'Last Ping of the Month' pings
- `Inherited` - Exclude the current month

**Business Logic in this Model:**
- "Version of GitLab with the metric instrumented" is dependent on the first and last versions where a metric appears in a Self-Managed / Dedicated ping payload.

{% docs rpt_product_navigation_base %}

**Description:** Navigation events are tracked by the team and identified using the logic contained. This has gone through iterations wherein the logic expands on the query but the tracking has gotten simpler. The resulting where clause is to capture past events and current but as we continue forward the past could become distant enough to simplify the WHERE logic to the current nav_* based event tracking. The intention of this model is to enable reporting on the navigation use in conjuction with our new nav project in 2023.

**Data Grain:** 
`behavior_structured_event_pk`; inherited from `mart_behavior_structured_event`.

This ID is generated using `event_id` from [prep_snowplow_unnested_events_all](https://dbt.gitlabdata.com/#!/model/model.gitlab_snowflake.prep_snowplow_unnested_events_all).

**Filters:**
- Only includes events from `2021-10-01` and on
- Only includes events where `app_id IN ('gitlab', 'gitlab_customers')`
- Only includes events related to product navigation. Some of the filters catch historical product navigation events, while some catch current product navigation events.

{% docs rpt_product_usage_health_score %}

**Description:** Use Case Adoption Scoring data. This model contains all Use Case Adoption Scores, the metrics that those scores are based on, and identifying fields for the Account, Subscription, and Instance. This model is used for Use Case Adoption reporting/analysis, Platform Value reporting/analysis, Data Coverage reporting/analysis, and populating Gainsight Scorecard values. 

**Data Grain:** 1 row of usage data per instance_identifier, per snapshot_month. That row of data will be from the ping with the greatest ping_created_at value in each given snapshot_month

- primary_key

**Filters Applied to Model:** 

- license_user_count <> 0
- greatest ping_created_at value for each instance_identifier per snapshot_month

**Business Logic in this Model:** 

- Each instance must be associated with a subscription and sending usage data in order to be included in this table
- More detail about Calculations, Thresholds and Methodology can be found on this [Handbook Page](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/customer-success/product-usage-data/use-case-adoption/)
- If a usage metric is not available for any reason, the score that uses that Metric is set to null to prevent that instance from incorrectly being marked as Red


**Other Comments:** 

- Use Case Adoption Scores are calcualted for all instances showing in this table regardless of instance_type. For reporting and analysis the filter WHERE instance_type = 'Production' must be used for accurate results
- For subscriptions with multiple Production instances a primary instance will need to be selected. This is commonly done with a QUALIFY statement that chooses the Production instance with the highest billable_user_count per delivery_type, per dim_subscription_id_original. (QUALIFY ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY snapshot_month, dim_subscription_id_original, delivery_type ORDER BY billable_user_count desc nulls last, ping_created_at desc nulls last) = 1)
    - This is especially important when joining this table to mart_arr so that subscription ARR amounts are not counted multiple times
- When joining this table to mart_arr the join should be: ON arr_month = snapshot_month AND dim_subscription_id_original = dim_subscription_id_original AND product_delivery_type = delivery_type followed by the QUALIFY statement mentioned above
- If additional usage metrics are needed for analysis beyond the metrics in this table the PROD.common_mart_product.mart_product_usage_paid_user_metrics_monthly table can be joined using the primary_key field on both tables for a 1 to 1 match.

{% docs rpt_behavior_code_suggestion_outcome %}

**Description:** Reporting model to enable Code Suggestion analysis and reporting at the grain of one record per suggestion. This model uses Snowplow events and can be used to calculate metrics like Acceptance Rate. Read more about how the Code Suggestions events work [here](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/editor-extensions/gitlab-lsp/-/blob/main/docs/telemetry.md).

**Data Grain:** suggestion_id

This is an alias of `event_label` from the Snowplow data

**Filters Applied to Model:**

- Include events from the app_id `gitlab_ide_extension`
- Exclude events without an `event_label` (aka `suggestion_id`)
- Exclude suggestions that do not have a `suggestion_requested` event
- Exclude suggestions that have more than one event for a given `event_action`
- Exclude `suggestion_rejected` events if the suggestion also has a `suggestion_accepted` event (see "Other Comments" below)
- `Inherited` - Include events containing the `code_suggestions_context`
- `Inherited` - Exclude IDE events from VS Code extension version 3.76.0. These are excluded by using both `ide_name` and `extension_version` values.

**Intended Usage**

This model is intended to enable reporting and analysis on the "outcome" of a suggestion. It 
can be used to calculate Acceptance Rate, Load Time, etc.

**Other Comments:**

- A suggestion cannot be both accepted and rejected, but it can have both `suggestion_accepted` 
and `suggestion_rejected` events. The explanation is in [this issue comment](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-data/product-analytics/-/issues/1410#note_1581747408)
- A visual representation of the different Snowplow events associated with the single suggestion 
can be found [here](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/editor-extensions/gitlab-lsp/-/blob/main/docs/telemetry.md)

{% docs rpt_user_based_metric_counts_namespace_monthly %}

This model aggregates the SaaS-equivalent User-based Redis counters at the namespace level.

**Data Grain:**
- date_month
- ultimate_parent_namespace_id
- metrics_path

**Filters Applied to Model:**
- Include events containing the `service_ping_context`
- Include redis_hll metrics with 28d time frame, which limits to user-based metrics
- `Inherited` - This model only includes Structured events (when `event=struct` from `dim_behavior_event`)

{% enddocs %}

{% docs rpt_event_based_metric_counts_namespace_all_time %}

This model aggregates the SaaS-equivalent Event-based Redis counters at the namespace level.

**Data Grain:**

- date_month
- ultimate_parent_namespace_id
- metrics_path

**Filters Applied to Model:**
- Include events containing the `service_ping_context`
- Include redis_hll metrics with all-time time frame, which limits to event-based metrics
- `Inherited` - This model only includes Structured events (when `event=struct` from `dim_behavior_event`)

{% docs rpt_zoekt_code_search_rollout_daily %}

This model categorizes GitLab namespaces based on their Zoekt search engine rollout status as of the report date by joining data from various source tables tracking Zoekt indexing and enablement status to monitor Zoekt rollout over time.

**Note:** 
- This model is set to never full refresh in order to prevent accidental loss of the [historical data](https://docs.getdbt.com/blog/change-data-capture) as there's no way to re-calculate prior versions without snapshots
- This model's unique_key is set to report_date in order to capture the final version of each day

**Intended Usage:**

This model is intended to provide visibility into the state of the ongoing Zoekt adoption across all namespaces over time.
_Note: Once the Zoekt rollout is complete, revisit the cadence of this model in FY26Q1 to determine if it needs to be rebuilt less frequently or retired._

{% docs rpt_behavior_code_suggestion_gateway_request %}

**Description:** Table for the analysis of Code Suggestions Snowplow structured events from the AI gateway. 
This model is limited to request events coming from the AI gateway (see details about filters below).

**Data Grain:** behavior_structured_event_pk (one event per request)

**Filters Applied to Model:**
- `Inherited` - Include events containing the `code_suggestions_context`
- Include events from the following app_id: `gitlab_ai_gateway`
- Include events from the following event_actions: `suggestion_requested`, `suggestions_requested`

**Tips for use:**
- There is a cluster key on `behavior_at::DATE`. Using `behavior_at` in a WHERE clause or INNER JOIN will improve query performance.
- These events originate from the AI gateway and cannot be blocked
- There is only one event per suggestion (upon the request), which carries an `event_action` 
of `suggestions_requested` or `suggestion_requested`. Therefore these events can only be used to get a counts of users, etc, not acceptance rate.
- These events do not carry the suggestion identifier in `event_label`
- These events carry the `code_suggestions_context`, but not the `ide_extension_version` context
- To attribute usage to a specific customer, you need to flatten `ultimate_parent_namespace_ids` 
(for GitLab.com) or `dim_installation_ids` (for Self-Managed and Dedicated)

**Other Comments:**
- Schema for `code_suggestions_context` [here](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/iglu/-/tree/master/public/schemas/com.gitlab/code_suggestions_context)
  - Note: Not all fields in the context are available on the gateway request event (ex: `model_name` is not available)
