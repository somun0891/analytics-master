## [Zuora Excluded Accounts](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-data/analytics/blob/master/transform/snowflake-dbt/data/zuora_excluded_accounts.csv)
Zuora Accounts added here will be excluded from all relevant Zuora base models.
* The `is_permanently_excluded` column is non-functional and designates whether the column should be permanently excluded or just temporarily.
* The `description` column is a non-functional helper for us to track which accounts are excluded.
