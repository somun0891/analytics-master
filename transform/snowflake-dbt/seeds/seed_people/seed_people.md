{% docs director_location_factors %}

The director level minimum location factors are currently hardcoded into the [Compensation Calculator](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/people-group/peopleops-eng/compensation-calculator/-/blob/da9d7101eb332d43cf621c70d8cfa1c002b1ed9a/app/javascript/calculator/salary.vue#L129).  If they are changed this file will have to be updated with the correct factors and dates.
